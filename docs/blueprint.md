# **App Name**: SetuCalc

## Core Features:

- Bridge Type Selection: Allows users to select the bridge type (RCC slab, T-beam, box girder, etc.)
- Input Parameter Definition: Allows the user to define parameters such as span length, carriageway width, number of lanes, material properties (grade of concrete, steel), and loading conditions as per IRC (Class AA, Class A, etc.).
- Dead Load Calculation: Calculates dead load (self-weight of deck, wearing coat, parapets, etc.) based on user input and displays the formula used, substitution of values, and the final result with units, referencing the relevant IRC code clauses.
- Live Load Calculation: Calculates live load as per IRC:6 based on user-selected loading conditions, showing the formula used, substitution of values, and final result with units, along with the referenced IRC clause numbers.
- Impact Factor Calculation: Calculates the impact factor based on IRC standards and displays each step in the calculation, the formula, the values, and the result with units, citing the relevant IRC clauses.
- Bending Moment and Shear Force Calculation: Calculates bending moments and shear forces, clearly displaying each step, formula used, substitution of values, final result with units, and referenced IRC clauses, enabling detailed manual-style verification of load calculations.
- AI-Powered Learning Mode Tool: Generates simple explanations of the calculations and their relevance to bridge design, providing accessible guidance.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Slate blue (#708090), reflecting engineering precision and reliability.
- Background color: Light gray (#E5E7E9), offering a neutral backdrop for clear data presentation.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080), used to highlight important values and calls to action, drawing user attention without overwhelming the interface.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif for clear and readable text, especially in tabular formats and explanations.
- Headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a clean and modern presentation of section titles and key results.
- Use clear, professional icons representing different bridge components, load types, and calculation steps to aid user understanding.
- Organize inputs and outputs in a clear, tabular format, mimicking traditional engineering calculation sheets. Ensure logical grouping of related parameters to streamline user interaction.
